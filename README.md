# Analyzing-the-Difficulty-of-Wordle-Puzzles

Final Group Presentation [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xBuQ1X5QB8)


Overview
Our group analyzed Wordle tweets data to determine whether a Wordle puzzle’s difficulty could be correlated with any particular characteristics of the Wordle puzzle’s word (e.g., having duplicate letters, being common or obscure, etc.). We looked at formatted Wordle results posted to Twitter to calculate the puzzle’s average score for each Wordle puzzle. We then determined which characteristics the puzzle’s word has and analyzed our data to find any correlations. We did not come to any conclusion about the effect of these factors.

Research Question
What factors affect how many guesses people need to solve a Wordle question? Factors include the obscurity of the word, the structure of the word (how many consonants, whether or not there are duplicate letters), and hints (how the player performs after getting a few letters correct).
